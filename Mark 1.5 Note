The Mark 1.5 is kept around since it is the only version that will support driver sizes up to 55mm, potentially 60mm

The Mark 1.5 is only designed with wired connection in mind. If you want an add-on bluetooth version, please use the Mark 2.

Extra materials needed:
Your own driver of choice
A long wire to connect the left driver to the right driver through the headband (optional if you wish to have connectors on both sides, for balanced signals, for example.)

Be sure to print out the right driver size as the Mark 1.5 does not have adapters for smaller drivers like the Mark 2.
